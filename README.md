Hello and welcome to this simulation game!

The game was created by a group of five, including me. This game was heavily inspired by Insaniquarium!, but we wanted to changed 
the theme. We decided that it would be really fun and cool to make the fish sushi and the enemy chopsticks! 

Thank you for checking out the game!
